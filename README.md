# prosta_siec_neuronowa

ALL NAMES IN CODE ARE IN POLISH

Pretty basic and simple neural net.

It works due to simple feed-forward and backpropagation functions. Neurons use tanh activation function. User can change number of layers, initial weights and learning rate in file "parametry.txt". Size of layers is defined by user in console.
No use of STL because it was forbidden (collegue project).

I used these features:
- Arrays (up to 3d);
- Pointers;
- References;
- Dynamic objects;
- Class (Neuron).
